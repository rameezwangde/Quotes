## ‚ú® Features

This application is packed with modern features designed to provide a rich user experience:

* **Dynamic Quote Fetching:** Fetches random quotes from an external API.
* **Promise-Based Caching:** Implements a client-side cache to instantly load the last fetched quote, avoiding unnecessary network requests.
* **Cache Management:** Users can manually clear the cache to fetch a brand new quote from the server.
* **AI-Powered Explanations:** Utilizes the **Google Gemini API** to provide insightful explanations and author context for any given quote.
* **Download as Image:** Users can download the styled quote card as a high-resolution PNG image, perfect for sharing on social media, using the `html2canvas` library.
* **Immersive & Responsive UI:** A beautiful, dark-themed, and fully responsive user interface that looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Secure API Key Handling:** API keys are kept secure and are not exposed in the main codebase by using a `.gitignore` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using a combination of foundational web technologies and modern libraries:

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** For custom styling, animations, and layout.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building the responsive UI.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the application logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous operations.
* **JavaScript Promises:** Heavily used for managing asynchronous API calls and caching logic.
* **Google Gemini API:** To generate AI-powered explanations of the quotes.
* **html2canvas.js:** A JavaScript library used to capture the quote card and convert it into a downloadable image.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rameezwangde/Quotes.git](https://github.com/rameezwangde/Quotes.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3.  **Create the Configuration File:**
    This project requires a Gemini API key. To keep it secure, you need to create a `config.js` file in the root of the project folder. This file is **intentionally ignored by Git** (via the `.gitignore` file) so your key will not be uploaded to GitHub.

    Create a new file named `config.js` and add the following content, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Gemini API key:

    ```javascript
    // config.js
    const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
    ```

4.  **Open the Application:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. That's it! The application is now running locally.
